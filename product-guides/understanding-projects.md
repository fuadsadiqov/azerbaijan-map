#### Navigating the Azerbaijan Map Project

In this section, we'll delve deeper into the various components and concepts that make up the Azerbaijan Map project. Whether you're a developer aiming to integrate the map into your application or a curious learner interested in the technical details, this page will provide you with valuable insights.

#### Project Structure

The Azerbaijan Map project is organized into the following key components:

1. **SVG Map:** The heart of the project is the SVG map of Azerbaijan. This vector graphic represents the geographical boundaries, states, districts, cities, and towns of the country.
2. **JavaScript Files:**
   * `countrymap.js`: This script handles the interactive features of the map, such as zooming and highlighting.
   * `mapdata.js`: This file contains configuration settings that influence the appearance and behavior of the map.
3. **HTML Integration:**
   * To incorporate the map into your project, you'll need to add references to the `countrymap.js` and `mapdata.js` scripts in your HTML file. Additionally, create a `<div>` element with the id `map` to serve as the container for the map.

#### Interaction and Customization

The map offers various interaction and customization options:

* **Zooming:** Users can zoom in and out on the map to explore different regions in detail.
* **Color Customization:** The `mapdata.js` file allows you to customize colors for states, districts, cities, and towns, giving you the ability to match the map with your project's visual theme.
* **Labeling:** City and district labels provide context and information to users.

#### Extending the Project

While the Azerbaijan Map project is ready to use out of the box, you can extend its functionality based on your needs:

* **Additional Information:** Enhance the map with pop-ups or tooltips that display additional information about specific locations.
* **Interactivity:** Implement click events to trigger actions when a user clicks on a state, district, or city.
* **Data Integration:** Integrate external data sources to dynamically update the map based on real-time data.

#### Example Implementation

Here's an example of how you might extend the project:

Suppose you're building a tourism website. You can use the Azerbaijan Map to showcase popular tourist destinations. By customizing the colors of districts based on their attractions and enabling pop-ups with detailed information, you provide users with a visually appealing and informative experience.
