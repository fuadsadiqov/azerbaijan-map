## Customizing the Azerbaijan map

The beauty of the Azerbaijan Map project lies in its customization capabilities. The `mapdata.js` file houses a range of configuration settings that enable you to tailor the map to your desired look and feel. Inside the `main_settings` object, you'll find options such as:

<table><thead><tr><th width="180">options</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Width</strong></td><td>Adjust the map's width according to your layout requirements.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Background Color</strong></td><td>Change the background color of the map to match your theme.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>State and Location Colors</strong></td><td>Define the colors of states, districts, cities, and towns on the map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zoom Functionality</strong></td><td>Enable or disable the zoom functionality as needed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
